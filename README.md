# HR Data Analysis Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes an HR dataset to gain insights into employee demographics, salaries, and employment patterns.  
The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook (`HR.ipynb`) using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn).

## ⚙️ Steps in the Analysis  

### 🔹 Data Preparation  
1. **Importing libraries**  
2. **Loading the dataset**  
3. **Find the number of unique values in each column**  
4. **Identify missing values in the dataset and list columns with nulls**  
5. **Describe the numerical columns** (mean, median, standard deviation)

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
6. **Find the distribution of employee salaries**  
7. **Calculate the average age of employees** (using the `DOB` column)  
8. **Determine how many employees are still employed vs terminated**  
9. **Identify which departments have the most employees**
